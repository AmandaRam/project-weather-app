# Weather App

This weeks project was to build an responsive weather app including current weather and a 5 day forecast.

## The problem
From start it was hard to see the logic and where to start, but to make it more clear what to I broke down the assignment into managable tasks. ChatGPT has been frequently used to solve issues that occured.
If I had more time I wouldÂ´ve liked to add some cool animations and changed the design a bit.
